<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a person full of passion and interest in learning new things and taking
  on new challenges. I am open and enjoy helping others. Besides being able to
  work independently, I can also work just as effectively in a group.
</p>

<p>
  My Swedish language skills have developed significantly after living in Sweden
  for eight years. It helps me a lot to be able to communicate fluently both
  orally and in writing, which allows me to perform my work tasks without
  obstacles. In addition to my Swedish proficiency, I am also well-versed in
  English.

<p>
  I always strive for the development of myself and my workplace. Moreover, I am
  continually working to improve my programming skills, always trying to develop
  myself more and more in this area.
